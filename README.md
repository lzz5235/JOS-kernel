JOS-kernel
==========

kernel-design

This lab is split into three parts. The first part concentrates on getting familiarized with x86 assembly language, 
the QEMU x86 emulator, and the PC's power-on bootstrap procedure. 
The second part examines the boot loader for our 6.828 kernel, which resides in the boot directory of the lab tree. 
Finally, the third part delves into the 
initial template for our 6.828 kernel itself, named JOS, which resides in the kernel directory.
